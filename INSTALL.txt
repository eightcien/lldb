LLDB Installation Instructions
==============================

Note that LLDB currently only builds out of the box on Mac OS X with Xcode, but
patches to improve portability are definitely welcome.

In addition to using Xcode you'll need to enable code signing on your system
to either build lldb or debug using lldb.  Please see the code signing
documentation in docs/code-signing.txt for more detailed directions.
