On MacOSX lldb needs to be code signed. The Debug and Release builds 
are set to code sign using a code signing certificate named 
lldb_codesign. 

If you don't have one yet you will need to:
- Launch /Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access.app

- In Keychain Access select the "login" keychain in the "Keychains"
  list in the upper left hand corner of the window.

- Select the following menu item:

	Keychain Access->Certificate Assistant->Create a Certificate...

- Set the following settings

	Name = lldb_codesign
	Identity Type = Self Signed Root
	Certificate Type = Code Signing

- Click Continue
- Click Continue
- Click Done
- Click on the "My Certificates"
- Double click on your new lldb_codesign certificate
- Turn down the "Trust" disclosure triangle

	Change:
		When using this certificate: Always Trust

- Enter your login password to confirm and make it trusted

The next steps are necessary on SnowLeopard, but are probably because of a bug
how Keychain Access makes certificates.

- Option-drag the new lldb_codesign certificate from the login keychain to
  the System keychain in the Keychains pane of the main Keychain Access window
  to make a copy of this certificate in the System keychain.  You'll have to
  authorize a few more times, set it to be "Always trusted" when asked.
- Switch to the System keychain, and drag the copy of lldb_codesign you just
  made there onto the desktop.
- Switch to Terminal, and run the following:

sudo security add-trust -d -r trustRoot -p basic -p codeSign -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain ~/Desktop/lldb_codesign.cer

That should do it.
