"""
LLDB module which provides the abstract base class of lldb test case.

The concrete subclass can override lldbtest.TesBase in order to inherit the
common behavior for unitest.TestCase.setUp/tearDown implemented in this file.

The subclass should override the attribute mydir in order for the python runtime
to locate the individual test cases when running as part of a large test suite
or when running each test case as a separate python invocation.

./dotest.py provides a test driver which sets up the environment to run the
entire test suite.  Users who want to run a test case on its own can specify the
LLDB_TEST and PYTHONPATH environment variables, for example:

$ export LLDB_TEST=$PWD
$ export PYTHONPATH=/Volumes/data/lldb/svn/trunk/build/Debug/LLDB.framework/Resources/Python:$LLDB_TEST:$LLDB_TEST/plugins
$ echo $LLDB_TEST
/Volumes/data/lldb/svn/trunk/test
$ echo $PYTHONPATH

class TestBase(unittest2.TestCase):
    """
    This abstract base class is meant to be subclassed.  It provides default
    implementations for setUpClass(), tearDownClass(), setUp(), and tearDown(),
    among other things.

    Important things for test class writers:

        - Overwrite the mydir class attribute, otherwise your test class won't
          run.  It specifies the relative directory to the top level 'test' so
          the test harness can change to the correct working directory before
          running your test.

        - The setUp method sets up things to facilitate subsequent interactions
          with the debugger as part of the test.  These include:
              - create/get a debugger set with synchronous mode (self.dbg)
              - get the command interpreter from with the debugger (self.ci)
              - create a result object for use with the command interpreter
                (self.result)
              - plus other stuffs

        - The tearDown method tries to perform some necessary cleanup on behalf
          of the test to return the debugger to a good state for the next test.
          These include:
              - execute any tearDown hooks registered by the test method with
                TestBase.addTearDownHook(); examples can be found in
                settings/TestSettings.py
              - kill the inferior process launched during the test method
                    - if by 'run' or 'process launch' command, 'process kill'
                      command is used
                    - if the test method uses LLDB Python API to launch process,
                      it should assign the process object to self.process; that
                      way, tearDown will use self.process.Kill() on the object
              - perform build cleanup before running the next test method in the
                same test class; examples of registering for this service can be
                found in types/TestIntegerTypes.py with the call:
                    - self.setTearDownCleanup(dictionary=d)

        - Similarly setUpClass and tearDownClass perform classwise setup and
          teardown fixtures.  The tearDownClass method invokes a default build
          cleanup for the entire test class;  also, subclasses can implement the
          classmethod classCleanup(cls) to perform special class cleanup action.

        - The instance methods runCmd and expect are used heavily by existing
          test cases to send a command to the command interpreter and to perform
          string/pattern matching on the output of such command execution.  The
          expect method also provides a mode to peform string/pattern matching
          without running a command.

        - The build methods buildDefault, buildDsym, and buildDwarf are used to
          build the binaries used during a particular test scenario.  A plugin
          should be provided for the sys.platform running the test suite.  The
          Mac OS X implementation is located in plugins/darwin.py.
