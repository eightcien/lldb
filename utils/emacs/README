The lldb-enhanced gud.el is based on the emacs 22.3.1 version from Aquamacs 1.8c
distribution.

To use it, load the file from within emacs and type 'M-x lldb' to invoke lldb.

The lldb-gud-window.png is a screen capture of the gud (with lldb) at work on
Aquamacs distribution 2.1 by loading the gud.el in this directory and 'M-x lldb'
on the ../../test/condition_break directory.
